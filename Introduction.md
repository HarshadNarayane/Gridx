How to use Gridx

Although also based on Dojo store, Gridx has a completely different architecture compared to DataGrid/EnhancedGrid. It has a pure non-UI core to perform all the logic grid data operations in a convenient and consistent way, a clean and intuitional set of API, and a flexible module system to not only make various grid features highly configurable, but also reduce the running code size when some functionalities are not used at all.

This article is a brief introduction on how to use Gridx. Gridx is still under development, and some APIs and implementation details are still up to change. But its basic usage and architecture is already stable.

The source code of Gridx can be downloaded from GitHub. Now let's get started.
